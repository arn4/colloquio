# RBM Library
This is a simple C++ library I developed for test the training algorithms I have exposed during the _colloquio_.

Unfortunately, there is no documentation. I hope the code in header files is clear enough to be used even without documentation.
If not, feel free to write me an email for more explanations ðŸ™‚.
